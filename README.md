=============

Master -> Development -> Simulation

Master:       Major Stable releases, code changes work both in real life and simulation 110%
Development:  Where most of the real-life code changes/testing will happen. 
Simulation:   ONLY branch to contain any RViz/Gazebo related things. Once we get things to work here, 
              we then merge only the non-Rviz/Gazebo Related changes into the development branch for 
              real-life testing.
